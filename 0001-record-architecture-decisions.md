# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2018-05-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I want to record and review the architectural decisions that I decide to use.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records.

## Consequences

Any reasonable decision that I think applies generally to many projects will be
documented here. I intend to review them once in a while and question my
previously made decisions. To get better and better.
