# 2. Apply clean code guidelines

Date: 2018-05-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As it's hard to understand code, it crucial to keep it clean. This applies in
all levels of code. Not only the code itself, groups of code, complete
applications and groups of applications.

## Decision

I will always focus on readaility and the ease of understanding any code or
structure.

## Consequences

Instead of inventing the wheel on documenting how to keep things clean, I
advise using the guidelines of
[clean code developer](http://clean-code-developer.com/).  
But the I put the biggest focus on keeping things as stupid as they are.
A former colleague once told me that with good code, every part of code is
exactly where it belongs. So I focus on always using the standard. Anything
not beeing the standard is hard to understand. Inventing new standards is
probably not what you need to do to solve your problems.
