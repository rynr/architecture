# 2. Apply clean code guidelines

Accepted

## Context

As it's hard to understand code, it is crucial that anybody can easily
understand the code you're working on. This applies to all levels of code, not
only the code itself, but groups of code, complete applications and groups of
applications.

## Decision

I will always focus on simplicity, readaility and the ease of understanding
any code or structure.

## Consequences

I use the guidelines of [clean code developer](http://clean-code-developer.com/).  
I put the biggest focus on keeping things as simple as possible. Someone once
told me that with good code, every part of the code is exactly where it
belongs. So I focus on always using the standard. Anything not beeing the
standard is hard to understand. Inventing new standards is probably not what
you need to do to solve your problems.
