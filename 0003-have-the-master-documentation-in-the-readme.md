# 3. Have the master documentation in the README

Date: 2018-05-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When joining a project everybody needs some point where he can start stepping
into the system, building it, running it, understanding it. The main entrypoint
is always the README.

## Decision

I will consider the README as the most valuable place of documentation. The
README of any project shall give a new team-member everything he needs to
join the team.

## Consequences

I will take the time to provide any information that is needed to start
quickly with the project in the README but not more.  
It should contain all requirements, the way to setup your environment, a
reasonable overview of the system, pointers to all involved other project or
parties.  
It's crucial that the contents is regularely updated and is not filled with
useless waste. This is also a indicator if the project is still understandable
for new team members, if it gets to complicated, something should change.
